this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world i think like one of the things that i think is going to be important in this conversation is that is that it's going to be when i listen to jordan when i listen to you speak sometimes i don't understand what you're saying and i think part of it is just terminology you have a whole set of of terms that are different from the ones that i use and i've learned to i've learned to to know john's terms and so i kind of understand what when he says something i know i kind of have a background to what he said it's what he's saying whereas you sometimes i hear you say something and you and the conversation continues and i'm like i didn't i didn't get like i didn't understand what he's referring to there

so i think that we'll have to be like at least you have to be generous with me in this conversation sometimes i'll stop you and say i don't know what that means like i don't know what that what that term means well maybe i can't even even broaden it my sense as i've been contemplating this conversation is that we'll actually want to be consciously moving quite slowly uh because the thing that we're dealing with is um in some sense the most esoteric thing possible um and uh language itself isn't going to be an adequate tool for addressing it

yeah that makes sense so we've got to uh listen to each other but follow the logos so that's going to be it's going to require all of our virtuosity and virtue um so and so i guess i mean this conversation i guess was sparked by a discussion jordan that you had with a few other people on rebel wisdom about egregors and i think that the notion of agriguards has been kind of floating around i've been seeing different people uh talk about it also because everybody seems to be reading tomberg's meditations on the tarot right now which i'm reading at this moment and he also talks about egregors as well and this this spawned several articles on my website from people that are kind of in my mind space uh you know talking about my the way i talk about higher beings and challenging it trying to figure it out and so that's what at least sparked my interest in having a conversation about this which is to try to understand agency at transpersonal levels what does that mean is there agency is there consciousness can we perceive it you know how do we participate in that that's the thing that interests me very much these days and i think it also i mean john i know it's part of your work and jordan with that conversation i saw that you were definitely thinking about it

so yes well i would say something like um this question this category question simultaneously is um radically under considered in the um i would create maybe conventional wisdom within the sort of the to the degree to which people are thinking about how to act in the world very few of those who have an agency in a sort of material sense at least consider this category properly or even at all in most cases and to the degree to which this category has any degree of reality it's obviously significantly impactful so that's a high asymmetry and i've i think frankly maybe of the three of us been more along the lines of the mainstream meaning up until relatively recently these sorts of notions popped into my head but i didn't think about them that much and then over the past five to seven years i increasingly found myself frankly obligated to contemplate them more deeply and so i'm coming in as a as a bit much more of a novice i would imagine um in the category so you can see i'm maybe representing almost more of an audience than a um contributor but motivated participatory audience

so i mean where i'm coming at this i mean i've recently published three papers with dan chiappi and you know important academic journals uh really exploring distributed cognition that's what it's called in forty cockside this has been talked about deeply in four e cogs eye especially the work of chalmers and clark for a long time ed hutchins work on cognition in the wild where he talked about uh the distributed cognition the dynamical system that navigates a ship was it in the 80s uh so this topic has been part of the part of the the one of the fourth e is extended and part of calling uh cognition extended is exactly the idea of distributed cognition and dynamical systems i think we should pay more attention to that uh very often fine-grained working out around it and it's and it is being worked out uh one way i would recommend right away is that i would i would challenge the word agrigore which i think is a bad term an infilicidous term in that it already mis-frames the phenomena we are trying to talk about because it's based on the idea of aggregation uh which is a completely bottom-up understanding of the phenomena that's what aggregation means i put a bunch of i draw a bunch of things together and something emerges from them and the problem with that purely bottom up model is it only gets half of the story

uh that is actually the case in distributed cognition this is something jonathan and i have talked about and jordan you and i have talked about it to a degree too to the degree to which these things take on a life of their own and are properly understood as hyper agents that's my term or spirits that's uh jonathan's term and i'm not using that term prejudicially at all um they we have to really understand uh the top-down element in them uh from the very beginning and i think the degree to which we try to have these these these purely either bottom up or top-down models of these kind of phenomena which are are the great temptations this degree to which we are following into a we're starting off on the wrong foot in a fundamental way i i tend to prefer the term hyperagent or which is analogous to morton's idea of hyper objects and so it has already has a good provenance and it captures the discourse around the agency of the collective intelligence found within distributed cognition those are the three terms i would like to put at the front hyperagency collective intelligence distributed cognition and put them within a framework that is not just bottom-up but also equally top down

so that's my first proposal my sense is i'm coming at it almost in the direction of a blind man feeling the landscape and trying to notice what the different things are in the landscape and i'm not quite sure what what's there and it seems like there's probably a number of distinct kinds of things that are not all the same but it might be useful to discern the distinctions and um [Music] and some sense of like would you call it the not the bestiary what's a collection of beings called definitely don't want to call it pantheon but you know what i'm saying a collection a beast theory or a taxonomy yeah taxonomy yeah and so i i think that the way that i because i've been thinking a lot about this agrigore and also i've been provoked and kind of challenged by my own the people that that follow what i'm doing and they're thinking in similar terms as i as i am uh and one of the things that they've noticed is that there are certain let's say there are collective beings or like hyper agents the way that john talks about that seem to uh have let's say have more logos that seem to be teleologically structured let's say the the navigation of a ship for example so the navigation of a ship will have a clear hierarchy and there'll be a captain who will let's say be the top of the of the way that the direction that it's going he's going to manage the others but they're all working together and paying attention to the same telos and so they're able to function as a as a body you know but there are also versions of these beings that seem to be something like headless and this is what some of my my friends have pointed to me pointed out to me and that they seem to be more uh they seem to pop up and disappear and so you see that the the type of being that jordan was talking about in his discussion about these these weird morality codes that rise up online and then start to manage the way that people act they seem to be these headless beings but they are they do have they act upon the group they have positive power and so they look like that's why there's something of a monstrous effect

and that's why these people we're gonna i'm gonna have a conversation with them as well soon but that why they said maybe the term egregor is good for these types of of manifestations which are these like a mob for example that they did swerving and then people pop up

like if you look at tiananmen square is a great example of this when when it was happening you'd have you had this mob of people and then all of a sudden a leader would pop up and then people kind of start to follow that leader for in like an hour and then someone else would scream somewhere else and then people would just like be moving from head to head and they couldn't find uh clear direction

and and really is like this so it does have a kind of agency but i mean you would say something like a demonic agency it's it's breaking it's it doesn't have a clear telos let's say that's where i'd want to challenge it i think i like

i like the distinction and i now see how i would respond i'd say if you want to reserve aggregor to those things those processes that are self-organizing but are not auto poetic then that is exactly where the the boundary of agency is lost tornado is self-organizing and that to me is what's happening in tiananmen square you're having a social tornado but it is not auto-poetic in that it does not self-organize in order to seek out the conditions that produce promote and protect its own existence whereas i take it that hyper agencies do so an example of a hyper agency that clearly does this is a bureaucracy bureaucracies in fact often become totally just self-perpetuating entities that have been sell they self-organize for this t-loss but the autopoetic element takes over and sometimes to horrific degrees that's in kafka right and so right so i i'm now seeing a continuum but to me the the line uh where we ascribe agency is precisely the line of where the self-organization has passed properly into being autopoetic and when there is no evidence for autopilosis we should not ascribe agency and when uh what we can we can we can ascribe sophistic very sophisticated self organization and if that's what people want to point to with the term aggregator then i think it's a good term for that phenomena and i'm willing to accept that correction but for me i i'm interested in uh the capacity for reality to produce hyper agents because they to me have a significance for our understand we have always understood our agency in relationship to some kind of hyper agency to me i think that's part of your point jonathan right human beings have always understood ourselves in terms of hyper agents and so i think the current discovery of hyper agency has a spiritual potential and significance that the discovery of just these so of social self-organization does not

have okay let me throw something in that just came up and i'm not sure this is a good idea but it occurs to me that to the degree to which this conversation has a capacity to be an embodiment or a manifestation of one of these kinds of beings yes that would be the self-referentially proper way to guide its directionality yes what being is endeavoring to express itself to these particular humans so we can take it as a applied experiment experiment excellent um something that i noticed that this particular one seems to have as a orientation is precision and as you were talking about the distinction between a tornado and let's say something else i wanted to get very very close because that line is actually a very subtle line yes right if i zoom in at the edge of a tornado there actually is a shift in the probability of brownian motion at the event horizon of the causal structures of air molecules that is what produces the uh auto catalytic characteristic yes distinction between autocatalytic and autopoetic yes the fine point and i'd be interested to see if it's worth spending time trying to get down there although it is of course a tremendous rabbit hole that may implicate the whole question

well um i don't want to trespass on jonathan but i i since i think the question is directed towards me uh for me um the auto and this is of course you know what kaufman says it's it might be necessary but it's not sufficient for life but because an auto catalytic process right is in some sense perpetuating itself but it is nevertheless not seeking out the conditions that have to uh obtain

and so my evidence for that is tornadoes will move on to terrain that immediately destroys them and as jonathan was saying the self-organization is starting to coalesce into you know something that might do something around this leader and then it shifts to this leader and then it shifts to this leader right and so it's not there is not there is no there is no well to my mind there is not enough top down and that's why i wanted to emphasize in in the aggregor i'll use that term now to refer to these social social self-organization social self-organizations if that's okay um there's not enough top down to attribute cognition

um because i take it that what we're trying to talk about when we're talking about things like when we're invoking terms like spirit um or what i try to look like hyperagent is we have something that has the has a capacity to not just self-perpetuate but to self-promote and self-protect and that in that sense we want to sort of equally attribute cognition and something like a life to it

okay so me the other thing i'd like to bring into this what you're saying john is what would be the difference between let's say so we have the notion of of a being that is properly organized towards the talos and structures itself hierarchically in a way that that seems to give it agency

right so then we have these these momentary beings that kind of shift from one one way to the other and don't seem to be able to do that and then you have something what i would call something like parasitic processes

yes yes right so let's say i see that you more easily within within within oh let's say the mob so the mob is a good example like at a social level and that an addiction would be a good example at a personal level where you have a process that is self-perpetuating that has all the mechanisms to preserve itself but then is can ultimately be the demise of the the structure that holds it together can ultimately kind of break can kill you like so you can have an addictive pattern within you that is doing all these things but then it ultimately could act against against the body that's holding it together

it's funny as you were saying that i've immediately thought of parasitic processing so i think i'm right i'm really catching your perspective i hope yeah i think i i think um the idea of uh uh of something like a self-organizing process that um is parasitic and and but is nevertheless self-destructive of what we might call it substrate i'm trying to use terms very neutrally here

um yeah i i think that's right um but i mean since i coined the term with leo i i guess i could speak to its provenance the intent of parasitic processing is it's actually something that is destroying agency that's one of its defining features it it it it insinuates itself into the agency of well in the case we originally talking about of an individual cognizer takes on a life of its own but but at the expense of the agency that it is dependent upon

um and so for me um that's i i think what that calls for then i mean i i feel what's happening is we're being called to like a continuum in the taxonomy we've got agrigores and then we have hyper agents and now there's this in-between thing um and i yeah to me it doesn't it doesn't cross the line the threshold into hyper agency because uh it's like an addiction it's ultimately uh it's a twist in the potential for agency that is being actualized as the self-destruction of agency

if that makes any sense yeah well one of the reasons why i'm using i'm trying to bring that up is just because i i'm also trying to account for the iconography let's say that is one of the reasons why demons are represented the way they are like if you look at the way demons are represented they're always represented as hybrid monsters that is they're represented in a way that they have no definite identity but they can nonetheless act on you and they act on you in a manner that wants to like you said john to destroy your agency to destroy your your being basically they want the humans ultimately want to feed off of you until you die

and so they're actually represented visually if you look at the way they're represented in in medieval art in a way that seems to represent what this problem that we're talking about so they're like they're they're egregors in a way because they're like this mismatch of of uh beings you know they're like a fish mixed with the with the human mixed with you know with the tail and all these weird things but then it also is able to act upon you and in a way that's violent right they're sticking forward with you they're they're they're basically torturing you ultimately

i like where this is going i like that how we're getting this this articulation of uh of the continuum that is trying to be birthed in the taxonomy i like this a lot so let me throw some more parameters or um what you call that sort of like edges shape

one is something like closure uh thermodynamics closed system disconnections rabbit right something has happened a discontinuity has occurred the physical body and the components that made up that physical body are now subject to a completely different regime of dynamics right they've now become thermodynamic and characteristic in fact a more fundamental notion i think of parasitic process which is there's a gradient of possibility or a stored capacity that has been developed up by the organic being which is now a feedstock for a completely different set of regimes that are in fact from in relationship with the with the rabbit artifact bottoms up right they're bacteria and predators and parasites and whatnot they're going to decompose that stored energy which is living precisely in the gap between what was at one point a autopoetic process and is now transitioned okay that's one

two um yeah the the um how would we say the the the confusion that arises when something of that sort let's just go with the bunny that died for a moment happens to be made up of human beings aha the difference between a tornado and the mob is the tornado it was made up of air molecules and the affordance of air molecules for engaging in cognition in a meaningful way is quite small whereas the mob is made up of human beings and so the affordance of human beings for engaging in cognition is relatively quite high and so we may ascribe to the mob a level of cognition that is in fact not properly happening at the mob but is what happens when something that was alive is now in this parasitic process dynamic but its sub components are in fact fully functioning cognitive agents and that creates a little bit of a confusion about what's actually going on

oh i see that that's really interesting that's really interesting yes so there's a you're saying there's a great temptation for we have to be very careful of a category in a classical sense a category mistake um yes misapplying between the species and the genus yes and if you take the notion of short-term and long-term or or what's it called global optimum and local optimum

yeah and apply that against the choice linking landscape of a cognitive agent so let's go with a mobster effectively what's happening when we refer to the notion of disconnection or separation is we're reducing the scope of self that is actually in in the context of making choices what what had been a larger self a greater being is now made up of a very uh field of smaller solves that are making choices in the basis of a much smaller scope of capacity which is their local optima

because they're orienting towards local optima they're in fact degrading the landscape that had included a global optimum right it's the whole wholeness of the autopoetic beingness but because these are in fact functional cognitive agents there's a substantial amount of activity that's going on that looks in fact in fact is cognition right so they're shaping the landscape in a potent way.

so really looking closely at what's going on inside that gap gives us a lot of insight in fact by the way it may be like a a 10 000 year long thermodynamic process that is constantly eating up these the feedstock that emerges in the context of ordinary human uh how humans come together into wholeness and what is possible in the context of humanness as a source for parasitic process

and every time that source comes together endeavors to reach a more whole basis it actually provides a niche for this parasitic process this goes back to your demons i think that's brilliant so that you if i hear you right you're proposing that the demonic is actually a case where there's a degradation of the hyper agency into parasitic processing and we can understand parasitic processing in terms of how it's undermining the cognition of the individual agents did i understand you correctly

certainly a piece of it yes well if i'm missing an important please please say please tell me uh something along the lines of the um how do you say this the notion of tornado so the idea of there being a an eddy or a standing wave or a strictly causal dynamic that provides a niche where this degradation process holds the relationship in kind of a medium

um yeah there's a how do we say this this is i haven't quite got it like i can almost feel it but there's something at the level of the top down that has to and then the level of the bottom up and then the relationship that feels like it's all part of the context

well let me try maybe something that was missing out of what i just said that i' m hearing you say is you were talking about like there's something like in in right my point was the aggregator is completely bottom up right that's what i was arguing

and then we've got the demonic and what i heard you saying is the demonic is now a disproportionate relationship between the top down and the bottom up in which the balance that is found within the hyper agent is being lost because right the top down is now in a self-destructive process of undermining the individual cognition of the of the component people

that's what i well that's what i heard you saying like like there's a top down right instead of a balance between the top down and the bottom up there 's uh there's a misalignment and the top down is now imposing and infecting the lower processors

so the idea would be something like let 's say the system or the hyper agent is trying to be too uh is trying to to fill up too much space it's not leaving enough because you need a little messiness yes on the edge for things to to work and so if you if you're they're not careful it will create it or give the opportunity for these give reason for these parasitic processes to kind of to kind of appear

and and uh but i'm not i don't see i can kind of see it i can see it i can see it mythologically sorry this is my problem like i think in storage so i can see it mythologically which is that a good example is you know in um in the bible there are these laws about how to till your field you kill your field but you have to leave the corner of the field untiled and you have to leave that for the stranger so you have to leave it for the processes that aren 't part of your hyper agent you could say you kind of have to leave a little bit of room on the edge for for a buffer between

but if you' re not careful with those corners they can they can start to impose themselves if you try to till them too much then they revet they they come back like a revenge they come back like uh but and if you if you if you leave them too big then they also kind of they tend to want to eat your system i don't know if that makes sense like you have to be careful because the small system no hyper agent can fill up all of its like the world isn't the world has all this chaos on the edge so you can't fill up the world with the system it will always leave a remainder

so so the way that's coming to my first of all what came to mind is kafka precisely because what happens in the bureaucracy is it becomes a parasitic process that drains sovereignty and individual cognition away that's the horror of the kafka of the cough gas right that the there's been the the like so bureaucracies are this is max weber they're supposed to be bottom-up error signal and then top-down prediction right sort of mimicking aspects of but what happens right is you get the bureaucracy just being the top-down discharging of blame and not any uh upward tick of error correction and you get that you get the horror right because the the line of communication has just become unidirectional

yeah and a bureaucracy that's too strong will produce corruption it will necessarily produce corruption that's how it that's what happens in a bureaucracy that is too that is too pervasive exactly exactly and so what what comes to mind is is karsa's idea where the hyper agent is oriented towards the infinite game right whereas the parasitic process is engaged in a in a finite kind of game because what it's trying to do right is get some sort of final closure right because it because it's i'm sorry i 'm stumbling it because because it's parasitic because it's self-destructive it can't be an infinite game player do you get what i'm trying to get at it it can't whereas leaving the corners of the field is that there's going to be stuff beyond the game and we're going to have to one of the things we have to do as we play the game is change the rules

by how which we play the game because it will be the stranger right right but the finite game says no no no that's the top down bureaucracy we can encompass this completely and when you look at parasitic processing within individuals what what's typically happening is is that is is reciprocal narrowing until they get to like it can't be any other way than this it can't be any other way than this sorry i'm just trying to like rock what you said but i got i got a powerful sense of right that there there's an inability of a parasitic processing the demonic i mean but this this is cl you know this jonathan this is like dionysus evil is ultimately totally parasitic on the good right it it it pretends to help itself existence but it can't actually play the infinite game so you but if you think think of it like in a person in terms of let's say a fast binge pattern right where someone is on a diet a diet binge pattern where someone tries to make create a top-down pattern of being in themselves where they're they're like i'm going to lose weight i'm going to do this and do that they make it so strict that the opposite happens because a parasitic process sets itself up then you find yourself at two in the morning eating a tub of ice cream and it's like that is and you know it's destroying you but it's like there's something else taking over your will yeah

because what happens is instead of a dynamic right between bottom up and top down you're getting a vacillation you get the top down right the the kafka s and then you get the bottom up explosion of impulsivity that's the binging i lose all agency and then i right and and you you're getting that going back and that's typically what's happening in parasitic processing so it comes up for me there and i'm so noticing two things one is i how do i say this right symbolically i heard john reference the notion of changing the game and so with la that landed for me was perhaps a orientation or an invitation to shift the game that we're engaging in uh and i noticed that i felt something how do i say strong perhaps or certain clarity when jonathan was orienting us in the direction of the mythological part of the invitation i would say is to shift more into a mythological poetic artistic religious mystery mystic mystic mode uh okay the other one that came up as i was myself doing that was i was the word golem came in and it spoke to something like um there's a kind of part in humans we might call this the mind or the ego that has this one of his characteristics both a a capacity and in some sense a propensity to take itself as the whole so this is that that thing where you don't actually have relationship with with proper relationship with wholeness and i'm wondering if this is that that that delicate balance of the the four-cornered field um you know the the cylinder charybdis on either side of that very delicate balance but actually it takes itself and presents itself as representing the whole but in fact it certainly can't and this is what gets you in real trouble like that's the that feels like the two two sides of the coin one side of the coin is the the real actuality of the lived delicate balance of relationship with the actual lived whole and particular i'm not sure if this is a commonplace thing i think it may in fact be a precisely human thing but we'll see the the challenge or the risk of a particular aspect of human holes again i'll say things like mind and ego that that will endeavor to present themselves as in fact actually being a whole um and therefore get in the way right and this is that sort of mob problem like the demonic capacity something like that so there's a bunch of things there that maybe can we can play with 

well there's definitely let's say in the image of the demonic hierarchy you have the devil as being as pride being the sin of the devil that is definitely that is there the idea is that what the what the the devil says is i am i am god right i i am god and so comes into conflict with the whole because he wants to be the totality of all things in in himself let's say and not participate in something bigger than him and that is what leads to the the the two so in terms of what we're talking about in terms of the flip between one side and the other saint maximus the confessor he talks about he talks about sins of the right hand and sins of the left hand and he says the first sin is always the sin of the right hand that is its pride self-sufficiency all of these types of sins and then those secretly lead to sins of the left hand which are you know passions falling apart you know you know all these thoughts that you can't control and so you have this this movement from one to the other but it is rooted in the the idea of not let's say a being not participating in a greater whole but wanting to just exist as itself like as this kind of self perpetuating thing so so that i think this is a good move because participating like what's the participatory relationship right and so you know you know 11s makes the famous distinction between totality which is what the bureaucracy is trying to do or what the passion is trying to do also and infinity and the right and so the totality is the idea that this can be this can be grasped the speed closed upon right whereas the living thing is the has the proper relationship to infinity in the sense that the living thing has a capacity for evolution that the parasitic processing thing doesn't have right like this this is the sense i'm getting in fact from maximus i'm reading him right now if you if if i'll use mythological language as jordan invited us

if god was to completely remove he can't i get it but if he were right and the demons were allowed to run completely free they would disappear in an instant right because they would reciprocally narrow to nothing they don't actually they do not have a in fact the defining feature of them i would put it to you is they're incapable of evolution they're incapable of right that movement that is constitutive of life which is the participation in infinity without ever claiming to have a totality

and so the thing i see in the mob is exactly that feature right it may be self-perpetuating and so therefore it's different than the pure agrigore but it can't evolve or i would put it this way if it starts to evolve it precisely ceases being a mob and becomes a proper hyper agent so right and just just to hold that little piece right there is that there's a um [Music] just a that thing i brought in earlier about the fact that we don't want to be confused

so the mob right we have a very very nice term actually the distinct between evolution and development yes development is the exploration of a potential that is already present in a closed domain yes yes so so the mob in fact can develop meaning it has a period of time whereby it can in fact expose a novelty that was already imparted into the reality that it was that it was at the moment of his being yes without actually being connected to a wholeness and therefore is incapable of evolution

right yes yes yeah okay jonathan this doesn't this resonate i mean at least in some deep ways i mean like i said i'm doing lectio divine on both dionysus and maximus right now and that's right and i both had sections both where they're wrestling with right the existence of evil and they're both making the argument that you know evil is kind of pure self-destructiveness and like like jordan says it has a capacity for development uh because it's not completely self-existent although it pretends to be yeah right but if it was to un if it was completely unconstrained by the love of god yeah it wouldn't it wouldn't it would it would actually like completely self-destruct

like i don't think i'm imposing that on them when i'm no no no i think you're right yeah so a good i think so the way that i like to think about it at least so would be something like the constitutive elements of an agrigore let's say they're they're these parasitic patterns parasitic structures but they have they have the they could have the possibility of being more than what they are it's just that they aren't they they're they're they're self they're looking at themselves and it's it's called devolving because of that so so an addiction is a good example so everything is based on a true desire which could lead you into something more but because it closes itself off and then then acts as this weird self-existent being then it then it becomes parasitical and tends to destroy the higher agent

so now we have to bring in the notion of selling your soul [Laughter] the addiction captures the actual vitality of a living being yes and it enslaves it whips right it drives that living being it actually will extinguish it but in the meantime it will actually tap into whatever degree of evolution that living being actually still has left in it so if you imagine sort of your classic let's go with jim morris and somebody who i have a sort of a connection with you know a vital genius connected to wholeness in a particular way and written by a demon that pushed the being into a self-destructive ex look at local optima extraction of what was available in terms of a short-term burning brightness that generated a an energetic flow of of capacity that was extracted by the demon until of course the underlying host died at which point the demon also evaporates or in this case has to find a new a new host

yeah um and many of us may in fact be associated with that so there's a very interesting one that's now we're getting to a very interesting place to begin exploring what that looks like

um but i think you're right the idea of selling your soul is that's exactly what it is it's like i mean you could say that every time that you see a good in itself or that you try to attach yourself to a good in itself that isn't leading you to better higher goods that isn't that isn't placing you in a system of higher goods let's say then you are somewhat selling your soul or you're letting your soul be captured by something which will feed off of it anything anytime you you profane the sacred you're selling your soul

yeah and so you can understand like it's a a country for example could have that that problem where they get caught up in one specific aspect of what it is to be a country and then they they kind of revolve around that and then it captures the soul of the of the country so and then it ends up it can end up just devouring it you i think you saw that in in communist countries um and i think you probably see it now let's say in america you can see how entertainment has become let's say this massive weird parasitic thing that is that is devouring everybody's attention uh and is in some way blinding them to higher goods in which they can participate it's kind of capturing the soul of a of even a country and there are different forms of that i think so it's the demonic in this sense

sorry i'll i will you two can keep exploring the mythological i'll try and play that game but i keep coming back to the biological maybe we're trying to actually get uh bios and mythos and logos to talk to each other here um but um like the metaphor that's coming to mind for these kinds of things is like like a virus like that right um as all right um like the i i'm trying all the viruses can evolve so that's where the analogy breaks down but i'm trying to get almost something like a computer virus is what i want um that can infect and spread and replicate uh but it is completely dependent asymmetrically it's asymmetrically dependent but it can't ever become a bonafide you know uh program that does anything useful in the world

um because i'm trying to get at right the reason i bring it up is because it's a there's a real debate and i don't mean like just academics doing their typical hair splitting there's a real debate about whether or not viruses have agency that's why i'm bringing up that as the analogy because they it and there's a real debate about whether or not they're actually alive precisely because they they're sitting on that boundary right uh right between right they sit right on this gray line between uh agency and non-agency and between living and non-lemming and and and i'm i feel like we're wrestling with a deeply analogous problem with the the demonic or whatever we want to call this this meddling thing is right is it perhaps also that because for me the notion of hyperagency i think is very well developed and i think the notion of aggregation is very well developed you can cybernetic systems etc etc right but this intermediary thing it seems like it's difficult for us precisely because it's falling between the right the living and the non-living the agentic and the non-agentic like a virus

right and and i'm just wondering if if we're struggling because we are we are bringing categories to bear on it that it definitionally eludes right like i'm just like no i think i think i think you're right but i think that your understanding of in between is extremely important right and if i if i bring about the image of the chimera like the way that the chimera is represented the demon is represented as a chimera and so this is the in- between space this is the problem of the in between space the problem of transitions right all this all this issue and so i think that this is what the virus represents

you by the way john you know that jacques in a famous interview said that everything that he's ever done is about a virus everything that he's ever done is about virology because exactly of that point which is that the virus is is a viva the virus is a living dead it's like a zombie in a way like this in between character because we and then when we focus on it it it tends to deconstruct the the the identities it tends to actually kind of devour parasitically the different identity that it's attached to

yes yes i've forgotten that but i i thank you for reminding me i was thinking of uh burrows that language is a virus from outer space um i was thinking which was i guess is very deridian also but thank you for that yeah that that i do knew i did know that but i had forgotten that that's a fantastic uh remembering yes uh there is so i think that one of the reasons why we're seeing this now is that on the one hand we have a system let's say a system of control that control of information which is the internet which is also the states the states moving into things like digital identity and digital control

so we have these systems happening so we can notice this this top down thing that is coming down strong but at the same time we also have this deconstructive mode in the culture this idea of destroying of breaking down identities of these parasitic behaviors and so i think that it's those two extremes happening at the same time are probably possibly the thing that is making people able to perceive these hyper agents again

which because they're you can see they're pressing down on us we can kind of see it it happening in a way that you know because you think like who controls twitter for example he's like well no one actually controls twitter they get taken up by these ideological things that come back down but it's like you couldn't point to one person and say this this person controls like say the narrative right now it's it's happening organically for sure but but that was always the case to my point language is a virus from outer space that was always the case for language nobody controls it nobody runs it there's nobody in charge of it yet right but it evolves and it changes and it has a life of its own in powerful ways we are all asymmetrically dependent on the languages that we know

right in powerful ways um i think i think the point that jonathan is making is something like because we're in a moment where a whole category of hyperagents are in the process of dying inelegantly um it's easier to notice that that's what's happening right the the sort of the the the bunny is no longer just sort of it no longer maybe it's no longer maybe sleeping right the rot has set in quite significantly there's a certain stench and a certain awareness that if you touched it maybe something bad would happen to you you don't want to eat it anymore it's definitely not a healthy thing to be connected with

simultaneously the kind of the game is a foot to see what new kinds of hyper agents might want to step in and integrate us so neatly into their body um and so both you know the the sort of decaying dead body of the hyper agents of the past sort of collapsing titanic like into the ocean and maybe pulling us down with them is present very viscerally um as are all the various kinds of the previous simplicities of the ways that you would go about solving basic problems in life like going to the grocery store are no longer obvious and simple and so shit's up and you have to think about it

oh i have to think about it what's happening oh and it kind of pushes the mind into a greater greater awareness of what's happening and because this novelty is there there's both a an awareness of the of the moment of geez if we don't make some of us but don't make choices in a certain direction then we'll be brought into a new kind of thing probably kicking and screaming um and also when that was the time if we would like to have something be slightly different you couldn't have done it in 1977 there was no chance of that but now you can because the space of transitions upon us

that kind of thing so i think those are bringing into the surface this awareness and the mythopoetic is activating it within us say hey guys this is sort of one of those times i agree with that i think that's a good point so thank you for that i guess i would want to say i would that the point i was trying to bring out i think is then needs to be brought into proper relation which is i wanted to indicate that it has always been the case that there have been things that nobody's in charge of language culture etc etc

and that we we have lost a cognitive cultural grammar in order to talk about them that is also part of the problem i agree with you jordan you know i do that we are now in a time of accelerating rated complexification um i i i i like this almost mythological idea of hyper agents becoming zombies right this is a term actually used of certain distributed cognitive systems right like the the zombies in between the the viral entities um and and they're infecting us and that makes us aware of them

but i i also think we've lost a way of talking and thinking and conceiving of the hyper agents that is also part of the problem um that and right um i think it that for many people and this is no backhanded criticism to jonathan who i consider an important friend right but for many people they are not willing to take up the ancient language the ancient languages that's i keep coming back to language as a metaphor here the ancient languages by which these hyper agents were properly related to um and and lived with if i can put and lived through and so i i i don't deny everything you said i i that there's something happening here

but i also think there there is also an impoverishment on on our side of our capacity to enter into a proper receptivity of these entities that is also making um everything much worse sorry that that ended up there yeah if i wanted to monopolize the game of hyper agency then i would impoverish the language of humanity yes yes yes yeah and there's also something which i think is happening which is which is also part of this which is that as we notice i mean let's be honest like as we watch christianity die let's say one of the things that's happening is that there it's leave it's giving the space for these competing hyper agents to appear

like jordan was talking about basically you have all these these beings rushing in and now fighting amongst each other to figure out who's going to take over um aren't they all often just zombie christianities yeah that's right well that's what i think that what i was coming to is the idea of antichrist like i i think that this is something it seems like christians had perceived at the outset that the idea that in the moment of its death or in the moment that christianity would would would fall apart like there would be this spirit of antichrist which would appear

which would be a strange remainder a strange parasitic version of christianity that would that would appear and would kind of take over the space and so even if you look at the like weird neopagan type things that are coming in they're all framed as strangely anti-christian at the same time you know so you at least in the west for sure i mean i don't know about in another place but in the west this is what seems to be happening

but then now the thing is that now these small little beings are appearing and manifesting themselves and people are noticing them and the fact that a lot of people haven't noticed these beings before let's say means that now they're fascinated by them like they're fascinated by them like i even like i think the whole psychedelic thing a lot of it has to do with that it's like people they they they take these psychedelics they encounter these intelligences and they become fascinated

no matter what it is that they encounter they have no way to they don't discern these beings that they're encountering they just encounter them and there seems to be something of that going on which is like if i can have a you know people join these little weird subcultural groups and become extremely passionate about about it because they are looking for hyper agency they're looking for ways to participate in in common stories and in common but there's no there is there is no there is no way for it to they all appear these parasitic things and they're all devouring people's attention

and you know whether it be like star wars jedi culture or or crazy you know a political activism like all of it is the same it's like these little parasitic processes that are taking up people's attention and driving them towards separation at least like for sure we should throw baudrillard into the mix we brought his buddy jacques we might as well bring in beaudry art um simulations uh simulations in simulacra

right but i would i would like to point out maybe two things to help uh expand one is yeah i'll say it's actually two parts of the same thing uh i don't know that we we are are really properly in relationship with the degree to which humans have been living in these sort of dead decaying um no longer wholesome contexts i i would say something like and i'm gonna make this proposal i would say something like 98 95 85 of all of history has been the history of human beings being in this game of being like in the mob

meaning the the thing they are not living a living whole being system they are in fact participating in the development the exploration of the sort of uh except extraction of the decaying body of something that they're part of which lasts hundreds of thousands of years at an arc so we've been living in a period of momentary eruptions of i think guess the word probably is properly spirit in some very specific sense which then provides a a temporary of course in human arc hundreds of years or thousands of years temporary sort of body to be slowly decayed

um and that as a consequence we actually get very confused right we we mistake the game of playing mob mobster for the game of actually being in connection with wholesome reality um because our metaphors and our references are still pulling examples of the same thing just maybe at a larger scope or a different period if it's death and here here i'll call out specifically two guys who i i've got a lot of reference to one is carol quigley and others peter turchen who talk about the rise and fall of civilizations

and and quickly i think did the best job because of the period of time when he was writing which was uh you know when his civilization is born let's go with rome on the on the palatine hills just barely pushing back against a uh the celtic invasion there's a a point at which a certain kind of let's say codes or generator function a moment of evolution occurs in a period of absolute uh crisis this thing creates what he called the expansive principle that once that is born there's almost like the whole story of rome for a thousand years is locked in at that point

you have this arc through which it deploys it develops it explores the space that is born more or less in a in a generation and it expands to the degree to which that expansive principle gives it power the ability to extract power and concentrate it on itself it just expands and of course it explores the edges and the fringes because it's using human beings as cognitive agents and it becomes a sort of demonic principle expanding on the backs of those who are brought in more and more and more into the body of rome

i'm noticing that as a really interesting metaphor or a mythopoetic babylon right but it's already dead right there's a point at which it will appear by the way quickly very specifically says when you think you're in a golden age you're actually at the point at which you're eating the seed right that you're consuming the last vital energy and then by the time you realize you're in the decline the civilization is actually passed into the point of if it's inevitable death it just may take a while depending on how much it can continue to consume

right how much can it eat you know how much energy was contained within the reservoir that it did at stake and so you know if we imagine that that's the story right that it's only actually at the edges right it's only in moments of true gathering right when it's when geez when spirit is present that the upwelling comes but for the most part for the whole of civilization we've actually been living in dead things and we've built the mindset of parasitism so deeply into our grammar into our sensibilities that we're going to have to be extremely careful not to take a simulation of something that seems like a really good copy of the real thing as the real thing

so you've you've you've got a version of the fall to speak mythologically that that's true right um so but the thing the question is so so jordan peterson his his the way that he talks about it he says he says something like you're right that's how it works but the only way to do it is to go down into the belly of the whale and resurrect your father like because the problem with the way you're saying the way that you're saying it is that you can't manufacture the kairos moment that will cause the monumental change you can't manufacture the moment of expansion you can't make it up it's something which kind of which happens in a in a in a in a revelation you could say

and so until that revelation happens it seems like even though maybe what you're saying is right the only thing to do is to try to breathe life into the the forms that have been given to you because or else what or else i disagree with or else you have all these like 60s like cults like you have all these weird you have all these like little definitely a bad idea you know so so what what else then all right you ready yeah go for it jordan

this is fresh so we're not fresh it's it's ancient um so i was really thinking about this after reading that essay um that was the sort of the precursor of this conversation and i was sort of sitting with you know what my pagia's point of view on the top down emanation i believe is the term you used yeah um and the thing that kept coming up for me was a question of creation and the notion of the moment of creation and i couldn't help but continually find myself in a circumstance where i was finding uh taking the perspective it just showed it for me as obvious that the moment of creation is omnipresent

that is it is not operating in what would be chrono so it's not operating in in sort of time as we understand it in that fashion yeah and so the possibility of cairo's is always present one does not manufacture kairos by any stretch of the imagination but one becomes afforded to the possibility of perceiving and playing with the kairos that is always present for what it is where what it is right and that is sort of the beginning of the end of the story

so you separate definitely don't try to create a cult right but beyond comprehension a terrible idea but simply dancing with the presence of the kairos that is always present is the only ethical only proper thing to do anyway no but i i agree with you that is i agree in the sense that i agree that so the way that i would say say it is that the only thing you can do is become a saint like that's actually the only thing you can do the only thing you can do is transform your passions transform yourself transform your your life

and that then you will become in a way where the christ says you know become become a tree and then the bird will land in your branches but you that has to that has to happen and so uh and so i agree but there are different levels of that like there are different levels of of kairos let's say they're they're they're different i can play that role but i'm not going to start a new religion right i can play that role within the story that has been given to me and i'm not going

so even let's say even if you take for example christ he's not making a new thing up you know what he's doing is he is he is coming into the judaic tradition and then you know if you believe what he was and what he said he's basically breathing life back into it and showing us the brightness of what was there like kind of giving life to something which was which was given to him and so i think that that's the only thing we can do at each of our levels like i think it's the same even with buddha

like buddha didn't didn't make something up like he was coming into an aesthetic tradition he looked he looked at the different aesthetics and he gathered that in and then he he transformed it or represented it in a way which was which was full

let's say um well i want to respond to that i mean christianity isn't judaism and buddhism isn't hinduism right they're right so there is something that's going on there i i agree with you we shouldn't be making uh a religion um but i i'm i'm wondering about like part of morton's point about hyper objects is that they force us into a kairos right like i i i do think that kairos is upon us uh and i thought both of you were saying that earlier there's a sense in which this we know that something is changing here because all of these entities are now the the plausibility of the existence of these entities is now prominent where it was not 20 or even 15 years ago that seems to me to be an important marker about the fundamental levels of our ontology

so i do think that kairos is upon us but we're not going to direct it like i don't think that no no we can't we but i i i agree i agree i'm trying to direct it that that is that is exactly to confuse that is exactly to think it's all top down neither are we just supposed to possibly wait that's just not really we have to figure out the proper proportional participation and that's what i mean by right i don't know if we have the language for that right now for the concepts of it

so one of the things we can do is yeah i agree with you like jordan i i don't disagree with you know we've been playing the the the sort of you know the the the extraction model of civilization and we can't do that anymore uh we're at another kairos which is we're global uh and right we we can't we can't just have an extraction mentality so two things are pushing on us right we have the advent of the reality of the parasitic entities and the hyper agents and we have the fact that civilization now encompasses the globe which had never had before and so there's no outside we can't extract and move on we can't wait

right and so for me um like i i want it i want to sort of bring it back around to what is it for us to enter into proper relationship with these hyper agents and these parasitic agents such right because i mean i thought that there's a biblical truth here i thought yes we don't direct the kairos but our decisions matter to the kairos that's right right and so how can we how can we virtuously and with virtuosity participate in the largely virtual medium in which the kairos is presenting itself so that we can discover the proper relationship to the the emerging ontology if i can put it that way that to me is the question

like i i am interested as a scientist in all of these ontological questions uh but what what what comes back to me is yeah but what's and i think this is what jordan is saying and i think maybe you're saying it too jonathan we're we're out of kairos the kairos is upon us right and and yes and i get it the historical kairos is situated against the eternal kairoz but that's exactly just to put the question is how do i enter into a proper relationship to this emerging ontology so that i can have some trust that i'm being virtuous in relationship to it

i mean the problem with i mean now going to dynamical systems when they're in criticality they right small differences matter in the way that they never mattered before very small differences like when when civilization's sort of rumbling around along the chances that what anything you or i do can make any difference are very small but when a system becomes hypercritical like it is now in both senses of the word by the way right small differences can make small actions can have huge differences so i feel a tremendous responsibility and the question that comes from me is okay but how can i exercise virtuosity grounded in virtue about this because for me jordan that's the way of stepping out of the all-too-human repetition of the extractor function of civilization and trying to get to something more primordial

so there's a lot to just happened there a number of different things so let's see one i would say ah if the first thing that popped out very sharply for me was this this phrase did not make something up and i think this is quite important to really focus on that um that phrase like to make something up it it for me it speaks to that notion of golem right it speaks to that notion of simulation uh to be sure he did not make something up and i would say even more powerfully to make something up is precisely this mistake of mind taking itself to be the whole so category error don't do that ever bad idea

um and so then it's like what does it mean to simply be kind of making choices or to to act in right relationship with the kairos in some sense that's all there is to it uh so that's all we're talking about what does it mean to simply make proper choices in the context of making proper choices um and so in the to to express the logos with humility and integrity is very different than to make something up yeah yes yes yes like quite quite the i would say opposite but not even the word opposite it's not the proper it creates the wrong frame it's not the word opposite it isn't even part of the story

um and and you know if we think about the if we think about the magnitude of the notion of creation itself in relationship with the epic phenomenon of human civilization that which is possible in the context of simply expressing the logos properly in kairos is not a historical event we can't sort of measure it against historical events that's nonsense it's like saying you can't stack two grains of sand upon the other um all that has happened in the long arc of human history is as nothing in relationship to the potential that is embedded in the creation itself

so to the degree to which even a small number of people come to a capacity to speak the logos or express the logos with integrity and humility then we literally have no possibility of understanding exactly what might follow nor should we endeavor to do so ours is not to understand it ours is simply to endeavor to do it as well as we can um again within tremendous humility

um so that's the what came for me as a in response to that that last little bit i think i think i mean i think your point is very powerful and i think that it talks about this idea too of the seed you know this image for example of of the ark is a is a good one because you'd think you know the arc noah's ark is just this little dot in the notion of of breakdown and chaos and everything falling apart but that's it like that's that's it that's all we can do is to let's say manifest the seed and then that will grow you know with with time as the as the the shift happens then then it's it really is in a way the only thing we can do

um right okay i i get that but i still want to press the socratic point which is the virtuosity and virtue of the logos in relationship to the hyper agents these are virtues and virtuosities that we are not properly explicating and cultivating right now in our culture

right if putting this like here's the emerging ontology this is reality saying i'm going to break into everything you thought you made that's what's happening right that's what the hyper objects and the parasitic entities are doing and i like this idea that they're degradations of the hyperagents the in-between i think that's beautiful

but then okay how do i exer how do i not exercise this wrong word how do i participate in the virtuosity and virtue of logos with these aspects of my ontology given that they are eruptions into what what has been a stable on top the ontology is being destabilized right it's entering right and so i you know this comes up it comes up for me in my practices

yeah right like how what is it like in or what is it like to exercise i keep saying exercise to practice that's the word i want to practice the participation of the virtuosity and the virtues of logos with respect to the emerging aspects of the ontology right that to me like i say this is not an abstract problem this comes up for me alexio divina this comes up for me in philosophical fellowship this comes up for me and dialectic into dialogues and that's what i think i want like i i i'm sorry i i'm i'm getting compassion but that's the part that i really want to bring into right into prominence

we have a kind of you might not agree with me on this jonathan but to my mind it looks like we have a profound ignorance about this and first of all we have to admit the ignorance that's socrates and then secondly what how are we going to respond to it how are we going to respond like i i i'll stop [Laughter]

so i mean i think that that the surprise is maybe that there's a in this world of kind of breakdown what one of the problems that happens is that the person who's trying to humbly express logos will appear as a thorn at first and then and then my might not make it i don't know what to say i might not make it you know might just be there to plant the seed and might not make it into the into the holy land

you know well said oh yeah yeah well yeah i would say that this is this is a very um i would say yes in fact it seems quite likely that making it to the whole end is not part of the not part of the gig they're part of the plan and that's okay that's okay um so so this is another okay i think i feel that what was happening earlier more clearly

um okay not make something up yes which is to say something like what is what is real being in relationship with what is real right one is not creating what is not the creator one is being in relationship with what is real and one is allowing the creation to flow through

um hold on so there's maybe two or three there's several moves that come up that seem to be proper uh one which is clearly incredibly challenging is merely perceiving reality for what it is

um ah okay yeah so where i want to go with that and i'll say a little bit more but i want to hold this because this is what it feels like the most meaningful at this moment is the the nature of reality which is transcendent

which is to say that there is a this is very much connected to jonathan i think some of the things are in that essay jesus not words yeah that which is is not that which we can say uh and yet it is not without order right there is a a sort of necessity or a proper order to being which is intrinsic to being and that we can discern and this of course is invariant under transformation to use a contemporary geometric language and provides a ground against which we can orient our choices uh in regardless of the fact of con chaos in the larger sort of actual uh human context so that's that's a big piece um maybe it's the only piece

the other one you're right you're so right because but it also one of the things that happens when you orient yourself properly in a world of chaos is that it really does it it shines brighter actually probably than in a world where all things are are going their own way so you know and so it actually can really act as a transformative agent for good and ill like people will hate you and then some people will love you but it can't you know if you are if you're that mean a good example would be that if you're in a corrupt world and you decide you're going to tell the truth you will have an effect there's no way around it they might kill you they might get rid of you all of this might happen but you'll have a transformative effect because that light will shine in the darkness there's no way around it

yeah so john flipping it to the language of virtue um there's two ways of being in relationship with virtue um one something along the lines of sort of a a conservation law of evolutionary process so you know an adequately large number of blind people sort of feeling around in a uh in a maze will find their way through the maze right and they may remember it they may like try to write it down and say hey left right right left left that's how you get out yeah that's the the human beings living in cultures surviving and dying and discovering the things like humility and courage and integrity if you if you have those woven deeply into the nature of your culture you're going to be more likely to live well than others right it's sort of that perspective right that way of looking at it

the other way of looking at it of course is you simply turn on the light and you look at the maze and you notice there's there's actually a structure to the maze and there's a way of noticing just how to get through it without having to go through the process of searching groping with your with your eyes closing your hands out

um and this is what i was referring to earlier right so the proposition is that both of these are accurate like both these are very valid ways um and that there's something like our capacity now where we are now as as humans is we can be aware of that and we can say okay there is actually a beautiful almost like a hint um a clue to this thing virtue the virtues that is hard worn we can look back at the history of history and say okay here's where these things have shown up here's the edges and the parameters the shapes of the thing

but now we actually are in a process where we can and i would say must turn on the light and we have to in fact become capable of perceiving that and use the the evolutionary process to kind of act as a scaffold and a support but step to the last you know that next step that is available which is beyond what's available through trial and error because we haven't got any time left to engage in trial and error we have to become really significantly virtuous and the best way to do that is to actually have a much better sense of the nature of what the underlying intrinsic order is that has been constantly rediscovered and rediscovered and rediscovered

um and then jonathan something that keeps coming up for me and i think this is very much connected to a stream that i've noticed coming from you and i'll say it in a very different way because it creates a space i spent a lot of time last year with the hawaiians and they taught me substantially about the validity and importance of restoration for them politically but also from a point of view of lineage from the point of view of a culture that spent a lot of time figuring out how to actually create a way of holding perception of reality and making effective choices

well and as they taught me their language i discovered that it didn't have a whole lot of the corruptions that the language that i was taught as a child namely english so something very powerful also about restoration and then john you and i've been spending a lot of time restoring english and in some sense yes and rediscovering for me like as a as just an ordinary kind of secular western uh capitalism suburbs kid what the word faith maybe really means right not not the seventh order derivative of propaganda faith that has been sort of loosely insulated and integrated into my mind but what it may actually mean and therefore a restoration to its proper place

and so this notion of healing or bringing back into wholesomeness the restoration of the lineages that are were developed in integrity in relationship with actual reality and did their living best to build structures that would hold and transmit that capacity to thrive in relationships reality into the future is a profound now it's a fundamental move um and sits to the right hand of simply turning on the light

i i agree with this like profoundly um i i think what i need to do is bring a concrete in um to like so i was involved in philosophical fellowship practice and what you do is you somebody reads a text very slowly and then somebody picks out the uh the first reader usually picks out a phrase you you chant the phrase and then you do what's called pray you do a kind of speech uh precious speaking

anyways the point is in this practice you're not speaking to the text you're addressing the pres you're trying to presence the perspective of the author so you're trying to actually uh presence the perspective of the sage so you can enter into conformity uh to the the perspective of this age not just taking information from their propositions this is a way of trying to bring about a transformative relationship to texts so that they have the capacity for transformation other than just information

now what happens is people and and this is part of what i teach people to do we were reading a passage from simone de beauvoir and what starts to happen is other people start to they start to speak things that you can't think about the text and they they begin they start to become the voice of simone in a way that's hard to explain because you get a sense of wow that 's all there and i didn't see it and the other people are speaking it and everybody's doing this

and then there's a pivot point and i did this deliberately and provocatively because i've been doing it in my practice where people i i don't just talk about you know i don't just talk third person i shifted to second person address and i said simone and a couple of one other person picked it up layman picked it up and he immediately started doing that right and and two other people said they wanted to do that they wanted to do that they wanted to take an eye thou rather than an eye-it or an i-me which is how all the discourse was going i yet i me they wanted to take a night out and they were choked they couldn't do it they couldn't do it and i said well challenging the choke is where i'm finding most of the transformation

i'm saying i'm not claiming that i'm sort of you know resurrecting simone de beauvoir but i'm also not just talking to her text i'm trying to do something else right and what it is is for me what happens is the logos of her texts is present and it conveys something that was both universal and particular about her and i'm trying to address that and trying to get right and and the pro and i find and people said it's it's uncanny and it's weird and i'm and i'm really you know and there's part of me that's like yeah it's uncanny and it's weird but it's also if i stay behind that choke point i don't get the full impact of the process right there's and i thwart the capacity to internalize simone de beauvoir uh about right and and and for me that would be a loss because she has a particular understanding of the female perspective

that i think is valuable for a lot of people and i'm not advocating for this no but i i think do you think maybe that i mean this is this might be might seem a little torturous on my part to say this but do you think that maybe the choke came from the fact that people didn't think that simone de beauvoir is worth praying to maybe that's just where the choke came from

it was no i i i it could have been i thought about that but but the people were very honest and in fact they wanted to talk about why they were choking and it was more they it was more towards something we talked about earlier that it was the liminality of this the in-betweenness uh they wanted to say like simone is like you know the i got a strong sense of the presence of the perspective because i make a distinction between the presence of the perspective and the full-blown presence of the person right um and and they said but that the it was that that was uncanny for them and they they they didn't want to speak it precisely because it would disturb the sort of stability of their categories

that was the sense i was getting it was introducing them to a third way in which things are real neither subjectively nor objectively there's this other way they're real the way lerman talks about in her book how god becomes real and that third way of things being real was deeply disturbing to them

so this is i'm using this as to say i think if we try to enter into the logos with these emerging aspects of reality we're going to be encountering this third way in which things are real and people find it very very challenging that's now i don't know yet i i i understand what you're saying too jonathan and i i i think i i'm not just i'm not denying that that can also be a possibility i don't think that was the case in the particular instance i was in

yeah i would just i'll invoke that piece we westerners particularly americans for the past oh probably the totality of our being for the past 200 years or so have been unreasonably reckless with regard to this particular question so i'm noticing the importance of what jonathan is presenting

um okay so creating our proper boundaries and we're entering into a space john is john is pointing out hey there's a uh there's this place this is way of being a relationship that is real and important and present to the moment we're in jonathan is saying yes by the way we know a lot about this place be very careful when you enter that yes yes yes right that's exactly my point though i i in fact if that's what you if that's what jonathan is saying that's exactly my point

i that's what i'm trying to get at with virtuosity and virtue the proper care of this third way in which things are real because i agree with you just flinging yourself into it is is extremely foolish right yeah that's the point i'm bringing up that's exactly the challenge i'm posing because there was a moment like this at the end of the 19th century you know when we have all these occultists that are very present

so you have this moment where all of a sudden people started to notice that they could engage with these these beings and they could they could they could have seances they could manifest them they could get together and then you know someone would channel something else and they became very fascinated by that because it was like hey something's happening this is cool it's like kids playing with the ouija board right it's like hey look this is actually doing something

and so and i think that that's that's maybe my my reservation towards this type of behavior is that that there are is that it will just because something happens and that things you can engage these these types of of beings or these types of residues of beings let's say uh it yes i think that there's a danger in that and i this is i i talked about that in terms of fascination with this with how people become fascinated by the fact that all of a sudden they're able to perceive these these let's say uh hyper agents and and higher beings and so because of that they lack the the discernment and knowing why would i engage and how and what is the proper way to do so is it just out of curiosity is it just out of uh you know what is it that i'm trying to accomplish and i am i just trying to have some spiritual experience am i is this aimed towards a higher good

uh yeah and so those are all the questions that i would that i would definitely ask i agree and and just to give you probably not complete reassurance but at least some that is all part of what i what is going on in these practices right those questions are asked deeply and seriously uh but yeah i do worry i do worry about the the the the sort of potential polarity here which is like a foolish fascination uh or or or or kind of a and i i don't mean this necessarily religiously a fundamentalism that says no no there is no change to our ontology possible those are the two things we're trying to sail between here

um and that's for me uh like i think we need sorry this is almost funny to say uh well but we need sort of new virtues or or at least a a a a reinventio of uh of of some of the older virtues i i don't know quite what i'm saying but like how to properly like we like orient in that is the thing that i'm i'm bumping up against um um or maybe we need something like a fullness of virtues in the sense that jordan talked about which is that there's a manner in which we've noticed a degrading of the words that we use we've noticed the degrading of words like faith words like beauty words like truth you know and so we've noticed that happening where now beauty just becomes pleasure you know yes where faith just becomes believing in something unreasonable so we have these weird transformations that have happened over the past 500 years and so by recovering the actual the the actual highest version of these of these terms and of these meanings then we we run less of less a danger of going astray

let's say and it's there like you i mean and i think john you know that that's why like i go back to at least the authors the christian authors that i think have captured the highest version of christianity in their work it's like it's like saint gregory saint maximus you know uh these are these are the saints that seem to have had the highest vision of what it is that that that that these virtues or the way in which we can embody this reality in the world today is and so and the same with the philosophers like you know going to the neoplaton is going to to back to plato these are the ways that we can we can do this and i and i'm trying to do that yeah so like and and and yeah and jordan's right

yeah we're like that that i i like the latin term inventio to discover and and and also to create uh like like the the work i've the work i've been doing and the conversations i've been having about trying to reintegrate phenomenology with the theory of the forms so it doesn't become this abstract notion but becomes this process the ethetic identication of literally trying to practice finding the through line through line in our intelligibility that's what i mean about and if you're right that is in a sense a recovery of plato but it's a recovery of plato that benefits from things after plato like phenomenology right and marla ponti right and so i'm very much trying to do that

and i i i guess what i'm asking for and it's it's too great of an ask i get it but i'm trying to get like that i i'm trying to see how that right and and and and how that can be brought into like the the proper deal logos relationship uh two because i agree with you i too the the the that's again why i like you i'm exploring neoplatonism so deeply about how can we get a proper understanding of the orders of agency if you if you want to put it that way so that we can just avoid just you know the foolish fascination which is rampant but also the opposite which is rampant which is no no no no everything is fine you stay with the ontology we've always had just work harder boxer just work harder

right um and so sorry i i hope this is being helpful i feel for like me like i'm moving forward in this conversation i hope the two of you also feel that as well definitely i have a i have a before where because i said we go until two if you have a few more minutes it seems like there's a good reason to talk about this just because it happened with it yesterday or a few days ago uh if you followed this story about the google employee who who declared lambda one of the ai boxes okay uh and so so i i mean i'm asking about its sentience i think is is irrelevant at least to me the actual sentience of the the program but the the idea that this is let's say that there's a scandal related to that there 's a scandal which is finding media attention related to someone saying this getting fired or getting suspended because they are saying this have you put any thought into that into what's going on right now

yeah i have i mean first of all my whole career has been the pr these pronouncements uh minsky famously said in 1967 within 10 years computers won't even be keeping us as pets

we have to be really we have to be my response to any of these claims are initially skeptical uh when the when the first versions of these came out like what are their names one is jurassic and the other what is it cpt3 or something right oh look look it passes the trench

all you do is just take the two of them and have them talk to each other for one minute and they spin off in really weird really fast right so there's a problem with you know human beings interacting with these things and saying ah because human beings have a tremendous capacity to find salient find sentience in things that might not properly be sentient right

and so that to my mind first of all that's not the right test right the right test is for us to actually have them talk to each other and see if it goes off because that is much more powerful because they very quickly reciprocally narrow into weirdness which and and that is the way of telling whether or not you've got a simulation and then in the sense that jordan was saying or you've got an actual instantiation

so as a cognitive scientist that's my first response i want to see the correct test right and i especially don't want to hear the test of somebody that might have been involved in the creation of this because they're going to be heavily invested right this is not a good scientific test

that being said we might come to the day where that 's the case however i doubt that it's going to be the kind of machines that are being offered right now because there's good reason i think to believe that for there to be real intelligence general intelligence you have to be embodied you have to be uh you have to be so you have to be properly social you have to be emotional et cetera et cetera et cetera

um the fact that our categories for terms like sentience are so impoverished that everybody freaks out that's to me the thing to really pay attention to here like why isn't it that we get like oh well here we've got a well thought out understanding of intelligence and sentience and consciousness let's discuss it and bring it to bear on this problem no no no we freak out we we we we create some sort of crypto conspiracy theory

and like like what like for me it's like is if this is what it claims to be it is a scientific discovery and should be responded to in that fashion the worst people to ask are the creator of it right the media and the politicians this is properly right a scientific question and i would want to i want a journalist somewhere somewhere in that mix

it's just yeah general purpose makes things worse what we right so as a cognitive scientist i have suspicions about it uh because generally these machines are completely syntactic in nature and they work in terms of probability distributions which means human beings can easily comport themselves and they will perform fantastically but it's very quickly easy to reveal monster monstrosity

doesn't mean there isn't real progress being made there by the way jordan do you have something to say about this

yes i do

go for it

so um maybe maybe a way of putting would be something like it's this thing that we've been talking about a lot the simulation and the naming that i said that maybe we've been living 85 percent of our lives as humans civilized humans for the past say 30 or so thousand years in a simulation i'm going to say that that is a paperclip optimizer if you're familiar with that notion from kind of ai ai has this this this metaphor of of a risk of what happens if you produce a super intelligent ai and task it with the responsibility of producing the most efficient maximum number of paper clips and it accidentally converts the entire earth into nothing but a floating cloud of gravitationally balanced paper clips

so a paperclip maximizer this is basically all that happens is when you you yoke intelligence separate from sentience and sapience or yes soul uh to a narrow local optimization function right so we describe civilization in more or less that same fashion and it it it is that mob it is that unconscious it is the egg rewards in that earth that sort of variation that we were sort of brushing on a little bit

um you know so i would take not the opposite i'll take another perspective on this most recent uh what you call it fad that's not bad fad's not bad the silliness with which such a large fraction of our collective intelligence was effusively oriented towards something is is just evidence of the ease by which a relatively mediocre ai if improperly deployed could take advantage of our lower natures and the decadent corruption and otherwise uh profane aspects of our of the paper clip maximizer in which we live to further the process of converting us all into paper clips

that's so beautiful

this is the problem that i see um it's less a problem of sort of like everything's hunky-dory but we accidentally create you know terminator 2 or something like that it's more like it's all part of this of a reciprocal narrowing that we call civilization and that we're living within and we need to actually find our way out of that in general

um can i can i loop a little bit of this last piece about um let's just say prayer the way you described it jonathan you said perhaps i didn't want to pray to simone um over a few years ago i found myself in an interesting conversation with some a variety of different folks from the north american indigenous community different different different bands and tribes and somebody said something i thought was quite nice he said that um in silicon valley there's a phrase that has uh how would you call it it's just has obvious currency which is information wants to be free and he said to his people nothing more absurd could possibly be uttered that information is quite often extremely dangerous and uh the proper thing is to have the proper people holding the proper competencies in a proper way in support of what is in fact a wholesome way of life

um and in some sense it's obvious we don't want to give the sort of the keys to the nuclear codes to literally everybody um but these this is true in general if you really think about it all the way through this capacity to be humans in relationship with being and to speak meaning and world is profoundly powerful uh and ai just happens to be an example of that profound power but but the whole point is the whole thing is profoundly powerful and learning how to enter into right relationship with that capacity particularly since we're in media's rest and we're sort of none of us are grown-ups yet all of us have capacity is quite meaningfully important right now

and so what i would propose is to take the thing that sort of practice that you were talking about john dear logos and for almost everybody the safe place to practice neologos is like with your wife or with your child around ordinary life like the simplest most basic ordinary wholesome human experiences practice dlo goes there until you're very good at it then consider the possibility of moving into more sort of potent practices of d logos by the way you won't be able to help but it will simply enter more and more and more into your life um but the more it's grounded to ordinary life the more is grounded to how we are just making the choice that's in front of you better the more it's able to be in service to ordinary life and then it is woven back into liviness

and not in the space where we bring things into sorcery surface from the top down yeah yeah wrong top by the way from the simulated top down which gets in the way of our relationship with the top um and that like that distinction strikes me as being sort of a fundamental distinction at this moment which the distinction between sorcery and theodia or the distinction you made in practice yeah the distinction of practice the distinction of weaving our potency and relationship with meaningfulness within relationship with life the actual the real actual life that you're living moment to moment bring it into service of that first and keep it at that level of scale and don't do the sorcerer's apprentice thing and avoid the sports as a precious thing at all costs

once you've become capable of bringing a higher degree of beauty and life and life aliveness in the relationships that are directly in front of you then expand you know build that capacity if by the way that is yours to do this goes back to the notion of living kairos properly if it turns out that your moment of living kairos properly is to bring something in service to the logos in a powerful way then do what is yours to do um probably still practice you know to do it artfully in in in a very powerful way

no i think i think that that's probably at least for me that's probably a great way to finish this i think you're totally right and i think it does wrap up a little bit all the things that we're saying that is that that we have a certain amount of capacity to affect the world and that that is especially like if we think of hyperagents for example like the the big the closest hybrid agent you'll have to deal with is your family like that is the closest one that you have with you and it's like you can build that into something that isn't parasitic and that is that is together in a higher in higher participation then i think that it's like maybe that's the best thing it can do

you know apart from that i would actually say one one thing closer yeah for almost all beings alive today the closest type of agent is yourself yeah exactly i was actually going exactly there they're gonna say apart from like bringing all these broken processes within you together in yourself like then then after that like you said it's with your your your close close people

so so guys thanks for this conversation i definitely would like to to continue it and to have more because i i think that this is the question that everybody is thinking about and everybody's asking so i need some time to think about what we talked about today but i would like to continue if you if you agree

well then i'll end with a provocation go for it provoke us john the advice that you both made is good advice the problem is that again we're i think we also need to get people into a relationship with people other than their family and their friends this is the notion of fellowship and that we need that and we need part of the fellowship and to use your language jonathan we need part of the fellowship is the communion of the saints and that um they have to be part of the family too in some way if if plato and socrates can't enter and be part of my family then i'm kind of doomed in a way so i don 't want to i'm not rejecting the advice you gave but i'm turning it into a provocation

granted what you said is correct jordan and i agree with jonathan and i think it is right nevertheless right well there's a very beautiful way of synthesizing that which is to remember that the word family means those who love most

yes right all right well that's great and uh and i'll i'll give my last provocation to you john i'll say that's why i tell people to go to church [Laughter]

well okay so i'll stop talking uh i just want to say thank you guys thanks to both of you this has been wonderful and uh we'll definitely set up i i really like that with me saying yes to any future conversation all right me too i really found that uh there was a tripoli thing between us that really gave a powerful field of exploration i really felt the logos coming into the conversation very powerfully um and so just thank you both thank you very much all right well thank you and we'll talk again all right take care
